**Travel.io: A Mixed Approach To Hotel Recommendation Systems**

Our approach combines two methods - a ranking system based on amenities and reviews and a similar image detection model. We believe that by incorporating visual information and users' personal preferences, we can create a more refined and personalized hotel recommendation system.

**Usage**

Our website incorporates a parameter-based selection process that involves choosing parameters such as price, location, and specific amenities. Subsequently, the dataset is filtered, and the filtered dataset is then ranked, with the images of the best results displayed at the top. Users have the option to select some of the photos, and a similar image detection algorithm is executed on the dataset. Additional photos relevant to the earlier choices are shown repeatedly

until the user is satisfied with the photo selection. The process can be terminated directly at the request of the user or when the dataset has been exhausted
