My negative feedback would be their hotel transport service from hotel going to the office which they charged us for 700 rupees considering the short distance of the office from hotel. Since my stay was a business trip reservation in their premier suite  room, a free hotel transport service for the whole duration would help to improve their service better regardless it was booked through agoda.

Not only they very quickly resolve minor issues but clearly close the loop and checkin with the guests about the satisfaction of the resolution.\n- Unbeatable location! It is steps away from Metro and walkable to bustling Jayanagar shopping area and pretty much accessible from most parts of the city\n- The room cleanliness is maintained well, again testament to great staff\n\nCons, and the reasons I do not believe this is a 5-Star hotel and hence is overpriced:\n- Cheap toiletry. The kind of soaps used by a hotel is a clear give away of their Star status and here Marvella falls flat right off the gate! I don't believe the shower gel they put in teh showers is even healthy, it looks that cheap! Overall ho-hum 3-Star quality toiletries\n- The breakfast is super boring! It is the same menu rotated everyday with one or two predictable variants (one south indian breakfast item and the dessert at the cereal stand). The music in the restaurant is loud and tacky Bollywood instrumentals. While the staff do well, the maitre'd seems clueless about their role and is seen meandering about aimlessly with not much greeting or help to guests.\n- The wi-fi is super slow, and slower than a public library! In this day and age when most travellers carry at least 3 devices, their 2 device limit seems like the 1990's (as does their speed).\n- There are no bell boy service, it feels odd that the reception office staff double duty as bell boys. Which would be OK, except if they claim 5-star status, they should provide 5-Star service\n\nAs mentioned above, on the whole I liked my stay at Marvella, but it does bother me they claim 5-Star status and pricing, but fall short on some obvious cases where th""}, {'Review_Rating': '10.0', 'Review_Heading': 'Exceptional‚Äù', 'Review_Body': 'very good '}, {'Review_Rating': '10.0', 'Review_Heading': 'Good experience in a great location!‚Äù', 'Review_Body': 'Bed was so comfortable and location of the hotel is close to Jayanagar and very convenient to commute!'}, {'Review_Rating': '10.0', 'Review_Heading': 'Superb Hotel ‚Äù', 'Review_Body': 'Great Hotel, great ambience, great facilities '}, {'Review_Rating': '9.2', 'Review_Heading': 'Nice stay but communication is an issue‚Äù', 'Review_Body': ""It's a great place to stay but for the first timer communication is an issue with auto rickshaw and even cab.""}, {'Review_Rating': '8.4', 'Review_Heading': 'Good but not worth the price ‚Äù', 'Review_Body': 'The room ceiling height is low, location advantage is the plus side.

He also decided to tell me how great Bangalore is in terms of weather, etc but the worst in terms of food. I dont think a front desk staff should strike such conversation with a guest who is from Bangalore. Speaking negatively about the city, isn't going to get you anywhere. I waited in the room for close to an hour and the so called bento box never arrived despite me calling and reminding them. Eventually had to step out for dinner.\n2. The room is just about average. The bathroom however badly needs to be refurnished. There is no health faucet and instead a mug full of calcium deposit. I have never seen a mug in a 4 star hotel and it is beyond me why they don't have a health faucet when they're catering to business travellers from all over the world. The walls of the bathroom have leaks which are plastered in a very shabby manner and not even repainted.\n3. During my check-out the lady at the front desk very matter-of-factly says she doesn't have change. No apology, no question about how I enjoyed me stay, nothing. Not even the slightest attempt to check with the restaurant which was just 40ft away from her.\n\nI would however like to thank the security who helped me with my luggage and the housekeeping for cleaning my room when I needed it to be cleaned. \n\nIn my 48 hour booking that I had there, I probably spent all of 7 hours at the hotel because I was absolutely disgusted and disappointed with the property.

The only difficulty was the location--although it is near the train station, it is actually surrounded by 6 lanes of busy, one-way traffic, making it challenging for me to walk to nearby restaurants, general stores,  etc.  To go even just one kilometer, one has to rely on rick-shaw drivers, who often hesitated with the ride, given the series of looping one-way lanes of traffic..  As one who is used to walking to a metro to explore a city, this location was a bit challenging and even isolating at times.

Don\' t trust the good reviews!!!!!\nSince, I didn\'t know much around Yelahanka, This was the only hotel which had good star rating in that area( My First mistake of trusting the reviews). \n1. The hotel is not at all like how it is showed on the photographs in any website. The rooms were small, smelling and worst\n2. The day we reached the location, there was no Parking! The mentioned parking was a small One/Two car space right outside the building and very close to the main road(I parked my car risking oncoming traffic and others scratching it)\n3. There is no facility to Swipe your debit/credit card! The receptionist is rude and doesn\'t respond or give alternative options to pay at the hotel. He just said ""Machine is not working, Pay cash/Gpay or leave"". He is dumb! No response! \n4. Rooms were damn small, I can literally hear what my neighbor room folks are talking, whenever they turn on switches, i can literally hear everything! \n5. AC\'s doesn\'t give cooling at all. Even at 17 degree\'s set, It doesn\'t cool up at all. \n6. The bedsheets were torn, and No pillow covers to the pillows! Pillows and Blanket had stains and once you sleep on it! You will start feeling itching sensation! We suffered a lot. \n7. Bathrooms are the WORST. The washbasin Faucet was literally moving around. If you want to open Tap for water, You need to use two hands. The same thing with hot/cold water tap! You need to put pressure to turn nobs! The bath room lock is so tall and tight, You need one hand to push it inside to put the lock. \nThe toilet seats were broken, and inside liner was cracked and one piece was broken! I was scared if it breaks! \n8. Once the AC is ON, It throws some foul smell (One from Sewage) it irritates the hell out of you! \n9. The curtains were dusty, with spiderwebs, They are so thin, that day light breaks in easily and hits right on your face. There was some construction outside, and they knocking everyone morning will wake u up by 5AM!
