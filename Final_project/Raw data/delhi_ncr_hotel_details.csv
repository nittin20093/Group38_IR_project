The lobby is beautiful and clean. Unfortunately aside from that the experience was a disaster from start to finish. When we arrived for check in we had to wait because their reservation system was not working. We had called twice to confirm a non-smoking room and were assured that we would get one. However when we checked in there were only smoking rooms available. We proceeded anyway and when we arrived to the suite we found over 10 flies in the bathroom. Dust rained down from the curtains when we opened it. We later switched rooms. Fast forward to midnight when we were awakened to a loud bang and saw that someone was trying to enter our room. It was someone telling us that it was check out time. After calling the reception we discovered that they forgot to switch our room number in their system. The next day we tried to use the pool only to find out that it isn’t owned by Ashok and they have this ridiculous rule where we can’t even sit by the pool unless we go in our swimsuits and swim in the pool. The whole experience was horrible and we hope you avoid our mistake of booking their hotel rooms. '}, {'Review_Rating': '4.8', 'Review_Heading': 'Acceptable”', 'Review_Body': 'Though the hotel has huge potential it is outgrown its own capacity. We were grateful to have a suite, less so when we discovers the terrace doors and windows were broken and allowed two nights of wedding party noise to flood in. The staff were, with one or two exceptions rude, officious and lacking in any kind of warmth. Breakfast was a farce - the staff and space simply unable to cope with the numbers. The door was literally shut in our faces and then, when I challenged the manager on his rudeness, he simply walked away. In the end we just walked in.No one subsequently managed the situation and even when we left, a manager was there telling people to wait (in my view rudely) whilst others simply walked in without challenge ahead of those who were waiting. The tables were filthy but to be fair the staff did attempt to clean when asked. Check out was brusquely handled with some staff sitting around doing nothing and guests having to queue to see those staff who were serving. We did use room service and the second time the staff member demanded payment despite our having given a credit card at reception. He then said he didn’t have a card machine with him. We paid cash and could not get a receipt apparently. It is a shame as clearly management are hopeless and the staff on the ground have no clear guidance .

We checked in 2hours before check in time.  We were given a king room in the mean time.  However, when it came to check in time, the suite was still not ready and after waiting at the desk for 20 minutes, I saw and heard other staff trying to get my suite for some other customer that was not even at the front desk where I was standing.   This was all happening  right in front of my eyes and ears.  The front desk staff have their own agenda and have no concern for the guest checking in, that is my experience.    I was told that at 3pm, none of the suites were ready.  I find this hard to believe.  If check out is 12pm, then rooms should be ready by 3pm.  One of the worst check in experience.\nThe room itself was ok, the switch at the front entrance controlled the bedroom lights which made no sense.\nRoom service was good, food was good.\nCalling the front desk from the room was impossible, the phone would just ring for 20 minutes, I had to walk to the front desk to speak to someone.  I tried to request taxi service at 3am, and had to call for atleast 30min to get a hold of anyone.  Where was the operator?  \nThe buffet was good, the service in the restaurant was good, price was good.\nOverall, for the price of the suite is not worth the experience.  \nI would not recommend this hotel.  It is well below an Accor brand hotel.  Being an ex-Accor staff, I expected more from this hotel.  \nTo make things worse, I was charged on my credit card several times after I checked out and am still waiting to hear back and get copies of the folios.
