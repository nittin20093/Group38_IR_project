First time I came with 2 other friends for a quick stay between connections in India. I wanted to check out the hotel for my solo stay on my return journey home bound. This time I arrived as a solo female traveler and am staying 2 nights, departing at 4am of the second morning for my international flight. \n\nI arranged for a car pick up from the airport upon arrival, and was greeted immediately out the gate by a Red Fox sign with my name on it.  Last time when I came with 2 friends we took a prepaid taxi from the airport together. The prepaid taxi from airport is about 1/2 the cost (+/-300 rupees), but being solo and arriving at night, I chose to pre-arrange for a hotel car pick up instead (+/-600 rupees). \n\nALL the hotel staff are gracious , friendly, hospitable and very helpful. \n\nThere is a nice cafe in the hotel which seems to have an ongoing buffet at all hours. The dining staff are also very sweet and happy to chat up a solo traveler dining alone. Mona Lisa and Yashpul were my kind servers today.

The moment we reached, we were swiftly greeted by a valet with a smile on his face. He made sure all our luggage is safely checked-in after proper sanitization.\nOnce we reached the reception, the duty manager completed the check-in formalities within 2-3 minutes and then came the manager wishing me Happy Birthday and handing me a double upgrade to executive suite room with jacuzzi. It left both me and my wife awestruck. Our expectations had already skyrocketed. The manager herself escorted us to our suite and gave us all the required details which we could have needed including brief about all restaurants, timings, spa etc.\nThe suite was spacious with all amenities you can think of. The cherry on top was obviously the huge 6 feet pool facing jacuzzi which made our stay all the more relaxing. We had a single number for whatever we need and were always greeted with a lot of personalization and a big smile. The dinner and breakfast at Culina 44 restaurant was amazing having a great spread having almost everything you could think of. At midnight, we were treated with an amazing & delicious cake by Taj with a message written on the plate saying HAPPY 30th. This was completely unexpected and very well appreciated by both of us. Most of the hotels I have stayed in have a very soft bed which becomes very uncomfortable. One of the great differentiator here was the bed which had hit a sweet spot of being adequately soft and not squeezing inside too much. \nAll in all i was amazed and mesmerized by the hospitality offered by Taj and will definitely visit again to other taj properties.

Both are incompetent. Sonu seems like a person with mental health issues. Will not send the bill to the room. Will not give the room key even after paying. Will make you wait and will advice the trainees at front desk to not attend to guests. Do not stay here if he is on duty. He seems to intentionally harass guests. Himanshu is another story. He continued to issue a wrong bill. After explaining his team seven times, he still sent the wrong bill and says - ""the bill will be wrong only because the computer generates it like that only. We cannot help it.""\n\nHe is charging me more. After asking him what is 4480+4480+4130 = he calculates it and says 13,440. He is the DUTY MANAGER. He doe snot know simple Maths.

Because of two bad apples, this property may lose guests. \n\nIf you have these duty managers like SONU and HIMANSHU, then run from here. Find neighboring hotels, which are all equally good. Call and ask if they are here before making a booking. If they are present, no one will answer your calls also if you need anything. the hotel goes to sleep when they are on duty.

The balcony was filled with rubbish – including a dying pigeon nesting in the corner.\n\nThere were no light switches or power points near the bed so it meant I had to get up to turn them off, and couldn't charge devices or use my CPAP machine. \n\nIt's also extremely noisy, with all traffic in the echoey halls — and the impossibly loud lift, which plays the same electronic tune every time it's activated — meant that it was almost impossible to get uninterrupted sleep. Often very early in the morning or late at night there would be loud banging and noises from the kitchen or service areas.\n\nTreebo is impossible to contact, and the hotel did not have a phone number, meaning I could not make requests or changes. I requested adjoining rooms for myself and my young daughters — instead, they were put in a room across the hall, which made them feel unsafe, given that random guests wandered the halls, smoking, with fumes entering our rooms.\n\nThe location is convenient to the metro and Kakalji shopping strip, the neighbourhood is very nice and food is acceptable but given the price we paid it is extremely poor value.

Good for one night, nothing more.”', 'Review_Body': 'We stayed in two locations in Old Delhi. We stayed here one night. I wanted to stay here because I am a fan of historic preservation. The building itself did not disappoint and is incredibly romantic. However, the room did, a little, with little things like loose faucet, sloppy painting etc.. they show the room in the middle of the building, which seems more enticing than the one we ended up with.  Furthermore, I recommend not staying in Old Delhi overall. Its chaotic, feels unsafe (or at least unpleasant after dark) and you can probably get better value elsewhere in the city. The bed is super comfortable, and the included breakfast is by far the best breakfast I had in India. However, the main drawback is cost. We first stayed in a location 500 meters away for 1/4 the cost which provided 70 percent of the satisfaction of the hotel experience. If you want to stay in a Haveli or palace, there are superb options in Jaipur or Jodhpur for a fraction of this cost. '}, {'Review_Rating': '10.0', 'Review_Heading': 'Beautiful hotel. Great Service.

Ask if someone on the staff can walk you to a the nearby Jain temple, or get very clear directions. \n\nAlso before you commit to anything, always ask what the final price will be. For example, they will be happy to arrange a driver to take you to the Taj Mahal. That's great, just make sure you ask that question to someone at the hotel. What will the total cost of this trip be? Am I expected to give any tips? What is the correct amount of the tip? (Also, if you are driven to the Taj Mahal, your tour guide is going to throw in a lot of tourist traps along the way.
