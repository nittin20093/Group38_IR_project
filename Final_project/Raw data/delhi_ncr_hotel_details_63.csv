The lobby is beautiful and clean. Unfortunately aside from that the experience was a disaster from start to finish. When we arrived for check in we had to wait because their reservation system was not working. We had called twice to confirm a non-smoking room and were assured that we would get one. However when we checked in there were only smoking rooms available. We proceeded anyway and when we arrived to the suite we found over 10 flies in the bathroom. Dust rained down from the curtains when we opened it. We later switched rooms. Fast forward to midnight when we were awakened to a loud bang and saw that someone was trying to enter our room. It was someone telling us that it was check out time. After calling the reception we discovered that they forgot to switch our room number in their system. The next day we tried to use the pool only to find out that it isn’t owned by Ashok and they have this ridiculous rule where we can’t even sit by the pool unless we go in our swimsuits and swim in the pool. The whole experience was horrible and we hope you avoid our mistake of booking their hotel rooms.

We were grateful to have a suite, less so when we discovers the terrace doors and windows were broken and allowed two nights of wedding party noise to flood in. The staff were, with one or two exceptions rude, officious and lacking in any kind of warmth. Breakfast was a farce - the staff and space simply unable to cope with the numbers. The door was literally shut in our faces and then, when I challenged the manager on his rudeness, he simply walked away. In the end we just walked in.No one subsequently managed the situation and even when we left, a manager was there telling people to wait (in my view rudely) whilst others simply walked in without challenge ahead of those who were waiting. The tables were filthy but to be fair the staff did attempt to clean when asked. Check out was brusquely handled with some staff sitting around doing nothing and guests having to queue to see those staff who were serving. We did use room service and the second time the staff member demanded payment despite our having given a credit card at reception. He then said he didn’t have a card machine with him. We paid cash and could not get a receipt apparently. It is a shame as clearly management are hopeless and the staff on the ground have no clear guidance . It has potential to be great but not managed like this.'}, {'Review_Rating': '5.2', 'Review_Heading': 'Above average”', 'Review_Body': 'Good Food, Good Service but totally run-down rooms.
