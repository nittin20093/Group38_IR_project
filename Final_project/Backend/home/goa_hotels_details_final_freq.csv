Cleaning is only when you tell them, and food is overpriced and not good. The hosts are basically not much of  hosts but basically like any hotel staff.

We found another Dr on google and that Dr helped my Child and things got normalised.\nHotel promised that they will do room decoration and cake arrangements (they did nothing) upon asking they gave excuse that kid was not well we thought that it won’t look good.\n\nDay 4: Check our day.

Not enough options in breakfast.\n7. No arrangements for Christmas dinner or New Year's Eve.\n\nAbove all, the Manager - Mr. Manoj was typical useless. Upon highlighting all the issues, he was not at all empathic with us. Asked for compensation since AC did not work for complete 1 day - he said I cannot help. Asked for management's number, he said he is the management and owner. Asked us to take the refund for remaining days and leave (if we want to).

Then I go to turn my TV on and no remote I call someone in who takes my room key and shows me where to poke it to turn it on I was astonished then there were no TV channels anyway so when I ask about this I get told they don't want to pay a TV subscription so I offered to pay for the TV subscription as they have always had TV previously I have been staying in this same hotel for 23 years twice a year. In 1 week my room has been cleaned twice the first time it got cleaned at 7pm at night as they forgot so had to do it when j got back and told them second time today all they have done is made my bed not changed it. Left dirty towels on the floor no clean ones and no food or surface wiped. Every night the reception is full of teenagers playing music however they are not guests and do not work at the hotel they are they receptionist friends!

Room cleaning was unreliable in general and superficial if they came (fridge was so dirty and disgusting moving in that we couldn't use it).

Even those 2 nights I feel wasted. \n\nLet's start with cons:\n1. Reception Staff is rude/ untrained/ below IQ people who are ready to start argument on any matter with which you will have discomfort. Let me tell you the instances\na. During checkout, the reception guy started arguing with lady whose family didn't get the balcony room even though she paid for and was there to discuss the matter after 4 days of stay. However, the reception guy started arguing and demanding payment in a roadside manner and this continued for 15 mins. The whole scenario was avoidable, if the staff would listen and understand what she was saying.\nb. This is my incident. I left room at 10 in morning and asked the reception to get the room cleaned knowing that cleaning time is between 2-5 pm and i would return at around 5. Although returned at 4:15 only to find room was not cleaned. I called the reception to ask why and when it will be cleaned. Again the reception guy started, cleaning time is between 2-5 and it will be cleaned between 2-5, you were informed during check in and blah blah. I askef him what time it is and why is he saying 2-5 when it's 5 already. He cited other guests rooms are also to be cleaned and blah blah. He was very adamant and rude in his tone so I asked in how much time he can get it cleaned, he said can't commit. So for these petty things you have to unnecessarily argue with bone headed people.\n2. Drinking water not available.\nUnfulfilling the requests and not able to cater to guests requirements which is the basic of service industry. They don't give you regular water. They only give 2 bisleri bottles each day. I had asked for water after my packaged water got over. They sent 1 glass of water. This is snatching basic rights of humans by refusing regular water.\n3.

Don't go because of location.”"", 'Review_Body': ""I had booked it for 4 nights initially, but by gods grace I changed it to 2 nights. Even those 2 nights I feel wasted. \n\nLet's start with cons:\n1. Reception Staff is rude/ untrained/ below IQ people who are ready to start argument on any matter with which you will have discomfort. Let me tell you the instances\na. During checkout, the reception guy started arguing with lady whose family didn't get the balcony room even though she paid for and was there to discuss the matter after 4 days of stay. However, the reception guy started arguing and demanding payment in a roadside manner and this continued for 15 mins. The whole scenario was avoidable, if the staff would listen and understand what she was saying.\nb. This is my incident. I left room at 10 in morning and asked the reception to get the room cleaned knowing that cleaning time is between 2-5 pm and i would return at around 5. Although returned at 4:15 only to find room was not cleaned. I called the reception to ask why and when it will be cleaned. Again the reception guy started, cleaning time is between 2-5 and it will be cleaned between 2-5, you were informed during check in and blah blah. I askef him what time it is and why is he saying 2-5 when it's 5 already. He cited other guests rooms are also to be cleaned and blah blah. He was very adamant and rude in his tone so I asked in how much time he can get it cleaned, he said can't commit. So for these petty things you have to unnecessarily argue with bone headed people.\n2. Drinking water not available.\nUnfulfilling the requests and not able to cater to guests requirements which is the basic of service industry. They don't give you regular water. They only give 2 bisleri bottles each day. I had asked for water after my packaged water got over. They sent 1 glass of water. This is snatching basic rights of humans by refusing regular water.\n3.

While there are more stays on this shore, I chose Sonho Do Mar for the staff and value-for-money experience. I have been eating at their restaurant for many visits over the years but chose to stay here this time and was very satisfied with my decision. I returned feeling refreshed and pampered.

We needed extra water bottles daily for boiling water for baby food and it was catered without any hesitation. Cleanliness was top notch. Got complimentary wine, chocolates, cookies, fruits and what not. Balcony had a cloth hanger for drying clothes which solved our problem of drying our wet beach clothes.\n\nFood: Breakfast buffet is excellent. Lots of varieties, great taste and top notch service. We ordered lunch and dinner in our room and we got tasty food. One advice: The dinner buffet price should be a bit reasonable and having different prices for veg and non-veg would solve the problem to a great extent.\n\nResort Facilities: The resort has a great view, nice swimming pool with a separate kids pool. The best one I liked is the tuktuk drop and pickup provided for the beach. Saved us from carrying our baby and walking upto that.  \n\nOther than these, the checkin and the checkout was super smooth.

KingSize bed with ample space for all 3 of us. (Me, my wife and my baby). \nGreat room service. They don't say no to any requests. We needed extra water bottles daily for boiling water for baby food and it was catered without any hesitation. Cleanliness was top notch. Got complimentary wine, chocolates, cookies, fruits and what not. Balcony had a cloth hanger for drying clothes which solved our problem of drying our wet beach clothes.\n\nFood: Breakfast buffet is excellent. Lots of varieties, great taste and top notch service. We ordered lunch and dinner in our room and we got tasty food. One advice: The dinner buffet price should be a bit reasonable and having different prices for veg and non-veg would solve the problem to a great extent.\n\nResort Facilities: The resort has a great view, nice swimming pool with a separate kids pool. The best one I liked is the tuktuk drop and pickup provided for the beach. Saved us from carrying our baby and walking upto that.  \n\nOther than these, the checkin and the checkout was super smooth.

From arrival to checkout and more, the staff have been fantastic. They go out of their way to accommodate reasonable breakfast request. They were able to help with advice on local tourism and help book cabs for wherever we wanted to go. All in all, they were fantastic. \r\n\r\nWe also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Charles. Like his team, Charles is also excellent as a host, providing a swathe of various activities and a full range of itinerary options. Moreover, on my arrival to Goa, I had a medical issue relating to back problems. Charles immediately requested for a physician to come in and help, and that made the difference to ensure I could go about enjoying my holiday as opposed to being bed bound. \r\n\r\nThe hotel itself is not massive, so it doesn't take 10 mins to access your room. The pool is lovely and clean, with shade and chairs to sit in the sun. Within the rooms, towels are provided and an assortment of soaps and shower gels.

One of the best budget hotel. Staff was very helpful. Breakfast was awesome. 4 different menu for all 4 days. 24 hrs hot water, clean rooms, all AC rooms, hot water kettle, small fridge in room these are few basic amenities you will get in this hotel. Room service you will get till 11 pm but everything is so near that even at 2 am you will get food around. Beach is hardly 8 to 10 mins walkin distance.  Nahida from reception and Sudarshan from F&B were very helpful right from booking to all other arrangements. Pool is also okay to enjoy. Tip : If you are looking Taj kind of facilities then please avoid this property 😅 but if you are looking for budget hotel with all basic amenities then this is the best hotel I can recommend. Don't waste too much of money on Hotel room coz there are too many things to do where you can actually spend money,my personal opinion 😃. I hope this review will help others to plan their Goa trip.

The location was very peaceful and serene and they even have their own parking with a security guard round the clock. There was hot water supply 24x7. The caretaker Ashwin was helpful beyond words.

The hotel has a shuttle to the beach but we didn’t know as we had to inform an hour in advance. In all we had a comfortable stay and would give it a 3 star rating for the following.\n\nPros:\n•\tWe booked a deluxe room which was quite spacious and clean.\n•\tThe beds had clean sheets and they were changed every alternate day.\n•\tBathroom was clean and hot water was available at any time.\n•\tAC was in a good working condition.\n•\tFood ordered via room service was good in quantity and taste, though a bit highly priced.\n•\tWifi connection was good. Make sure you ask details at the reception as they don’t provide it otherwise.\n•\tThey cleaned the room on a daily basis. They also changed the towels and kept two bottles of water.\n•\tThere was a mini fridge and tea kettle in the room.\n•\tReception was courteous and staff was polite.\n\nCons:\n•\tFew taps in the bathroom was leaking so it was always wet. \n•\tThe power sockets were far from the bed and also had loose connection.\n•\tTV was small and far from the bed.\n•\tThey don’t have bells outside the room so people have to knock on the door.\n•\tWe got a room in the old wing of the hotel where there was some repair work going on so there was disturbance.\n•\tThey have a pick up and drop facility from the airport for Rs. 3000 for both ways on a sharing basis which is more expensive than the cabs.

But also pool is directly under trees one will find few leaves, bugs , flowers etc in water. except this all seemed well.\n\nFinally, my suggestion in case if you are planning to stay here. please stay. ingore all other bad reviews. i was there from 22 Nov till 25 Nov 16. Also rooms very clean n toilets too clean. with basic facilities like hair dryer, fridge tea coffee maker  tea coffee whiter bags etc'}, {'Review_Rating': '6.4', 'Review_Heading': 'Decent place for staying in Goa ”', 'Review_Body': 'Location is perfect for trip to North Goa. '}, {'Review_Rating': '7.2', 'Review_Heading': 'Good stay”', 'Review_Body': 'We stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is pretty close to the beach and other restaurants. It takes about 10-15 mins walking to Calangute beach as there is lot of traffic so make sure you have your own vehicle or rent a car/ bike as cabs charge a high price. The hotel has a shuttle to the beach but we didn’t know as we had to inform an hour in advance. In all we had a comfortable stay and would give it a 3 star rating for the following.\n\nPros:\n•\tWe booked a deluxe room which was quite spacious and clean.\n•\tThe beds had clean sheets and they were changed every alternate day.\n•\tBathroom was clean and hot water was available at any time.\n•\tAC was in a good working condition.\n•\tFood ordered via room service was good in quantity and taste, though a bit highly priced.\n•\tWifi connection was good. Make sure you ask details at the reception as they don’t provide it otherwise.\n•\tThey cleaned the room on a daily basis. They also changed the towels and kept two bottles of water.\n•\tThere was a mini fridge and tea kettle in the room.\n•\tReception was courteous and staff was polite.\n\nCons:\n•\tFew taps in the bathroom was leaking so it was always wet. \n•\tThe power sockets were far from the bed and also had loose connection.\n•\tTV was small and far from the bed.\n•\tThey don’t have bells outside the room so people have to knock on the door.\n•\tWe got a room in the old wing of the hotel where there was some repair work going on so there was disturbance.\n•\tThey have a pick up and drop facility from the airport for Rs. 3000 for both ways on a sharing basis which is more expensive than the cabs. We got cab which is just outside the hotel Rs. 2600 approx both ways.\n'}, {'Review_Rating': '2.0', 'Review_Heading': 'Not good hotel”', 'Review_Body': 'Location is far from main market.
